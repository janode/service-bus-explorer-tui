# Rust Standards Check

Evaluate the provided code against the Rust standards enforced in this project. Flag violations and explain why each matters.

## Type System and State Modeling

- Use enums to model states — not booleans, string flags, or `Option<Option<T>>`
- Encode invariants in types so invalid states are unrepresentable
- Avoid stringly-typed logic (sentinel strings are acceptable at the event loop boundary only — do not introduce new ones in business logic)
- Use `newtype` wrappers to prevent mixing semantically different values of the same type

## Ownership and Borrowing

- Prefer owned types at API boundaries, borrows internally
- Avoid unnecessary `.clone()` — if a clone exists, justify it
- Do not fight the borrow checker with workarounds — fix the design
- Lifetime annotations are acceptable; lifetime gymnastics are a design smell

## Error Handling

- Use `Result<T, E>` everywhere — never `unwrap()` or `expect()` in non-test code unless the invariant is proven at the call site
- Use `thiserror` for library/module error types (already present in this project as `ServiceBusError`)
- Use `anyhow` only at application boundary (top-level handlers, `main`)
- Propagate errors with `?` — do not silently discard them
- Log errors before discarding — a swallowed error is a hidden failure
- Error messages must include enough context to diagnose the problem (include what was attempted and what was received)

## Async / tokio

- Never block inside an async context — no `std::thread::sleep`, no synchronous I/O
- Do not create nested tokio runtimes (`tokio::runtime::Builder` inside an already-async context)
- Prefer `tokio::select!` with `CancellationToken` for graceful shutdown
- Clone clients (`reqwest::Client`, connection config) before moving into `tokio::spawn` — do not share references across spawn boundaries
- Use bounded channels when message volume is unbounded; use unbounded (`mpsc::unbounded_channel`) only when the sender is rate-limited by the event loop

## Resource Management

- Drop-based cleanup over manual cleanup — implement `Drop` if teardown is required
- No unbounded buffers: if you are collecting into a `Vec`, know the maximum size
- Semaphores or bounded channels for concurrency control on parallel spawns
- Retry logic must use jitter — bare `tokio::time::sleep` retry loops are not acceptable

## Performance

- Do not allocate inside hot loops (event loop tick, render loop)
- Avoid `format!` in tight loops — use `write!` into a pre-allocated buffer
- Measure before accepting a clone or allocation cost
- Streaming over buffering when working with large API responses

## What Good Looks Like in This Codebase

```rust
// Good: type encodes state
pub enum FocusPanel { Tree, Detail, Messages }

// Bad: boolean flag for state
let is_tree_focused: bool = true;

// Good: error with context
return Err(ServiceBusError::Xml(format!(
    "expected <title> element in entry, got: {:?}", &entry_xml[..100]
)));

// Bad: silent discard
let _ = parse_optional_i64(xml, "Count"); // why is the result ignored?

// Good: clone justified, client is Send + cheap to clone
let dp = app.data_plane.clone().unwrap();
tokio::spawn(async move { dp.peek(&path).await });

// Bad: clone of large state struct
let app_clone = app.clone(); // App is not designed to be cloned
```

## Checklist

- [ ] No `unwrap()`/`expect()` outside test code or proven-invariant sites
- [ ] All `Result` values propagated or explicitly handled with justification
- [ ] No blocking calls in async functions
- [ ] No unnecessary clones — each clone is justified
- [ ] Enums used for state, not booleans/strings
- [ ] Error messages include context (what was tried + what was received)
- [ ] No unbounded resource growth (channels, vecs, retry loops)
